Not all the tuples are consistent. The number of faulty is tuples: 17494/35624
This is suspicious, all the tuples that are faulty miss 100% of the cds, meaning none of the coding regions defined in their CCDS dataset 
occurence are found in the human genome file, for the number of accession specified.

It would be normal to miss some of the cds in certain tuples of the dataset, but not every single CDS. This might indicate that we are 
lacking some knowledge about the dataset and that we should perhaps handle accession numbers differently, or some other issue.

Still, we have created 18_130 valid tuples, which would be enough to start with the fine-tuning process.
